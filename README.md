# Clustering---Comparing-between-K-Means-and-DBSCAN

Given a dataset clustering.csv (i.e., consists of 2 columns - basically x and y coordinates of numerous points), I conducted the following:

1) Perform K-Means clustering on the dataset - use WCSS to find best K value
2) Perform DBSCAN clustering on the dataset - use knee locator to find the optimal parameter 
3) Briefly compare the 2 methods and discuss on the results and findings
